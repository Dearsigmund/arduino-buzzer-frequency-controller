Features:

    Adjustable Frequency: Increase or decrease the buzzer frequency with push buttons.
    Debouncing: Ensures accurate and reliable button presses.
    Real-Time Control: Immediate response to button inputs.

Components:

    Arduino board
    Passive buzzer
    Push buttons
    Resistors (if necessary)
    Breadboard and jumper wires

Usage:

    Connect the components as specified in the circuit diagram.
    Upload the provided code to your Arduino.
    Press the buttons to adjust the buzzer frequency.
